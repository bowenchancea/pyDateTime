# pyDateTime
playing with datetime in Python
trying to create a way in order to just draw each portion of data from the timedelta function of datetime module in Python, this is just the beginning

07/19/22

made changes to allow for two variables as well as including new comments to better describe the module and its pieces.
included ways to declare times without importing datetime to the module
made a countdown clock for fun.
Plans for future:
-no known, I think I have achieved what I wanted with this

07/18/22

made the original module that works, but is mainly just the difference between a future date and now.
short session of actually coding, was getting GitHub setup, as well as getting IDE working on another computer.
Plans for Next Time:
-change the arguments to allow for two different dates
