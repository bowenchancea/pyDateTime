# pyDateTime
playing with datetime in Python
trying to create a way in order to just draw each portion of data from the timedelta function of datetime module in Python, this is just the beginning

07/18/22

made the original module that works, but is mainly just the difference between a future date and now.
short session of actually coding, was getting GitHub setup, as well as getting IDE working on another computer.
Plans for Next Time:
-change the arguments to allow for two different dates
